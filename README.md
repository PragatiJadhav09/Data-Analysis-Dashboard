# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I have developed interactive project using Tableau and Python, to analyze the data and give complaint insights and financial trends. This process involved several stages, including data processing, cleansing and visualization.

# Overview
The goal of the project was to create a Tableau dashboard to analyze and monitor complaints data in order to support the strategic initiatives aimed at reducing complaints and settlement amounts by 20%. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into complaints trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and insights relevant to the strategic goals of the organization. The data preparation was done using a Jupyter notebook, where the necessary transformations were performed before visualizing the results in Tableau.

# Objective
The main objective of this dashboard is to:
1. Track the current complaints trend.
2. Monitor how UnitedHealthcare is performing against competitors.
3. Provide insights into potential unfair claims practices.
4. Offer an overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business.
This dashboard was designed to be an easy-to-understand visualization tool that can assist the leadership team in tracking progress towards their goals and identifying areas for improvement.
